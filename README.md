# YOLOv8 Object Detection with Class Filtering & Export (Streamlit App)

This project implements an **object detection web application using YOLOv8 and Streamlit**.  
It supports **image and video detection**, **class-based filtering**, **confidence thresholding**, and **CSV export** of detected objects.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical usage of deep learning–based object detection with an interactive user interface.

## Features

- ✅ YOLOv8 object detection
- ✅ Image and video input support
- ✅ Adjustable confidence threshold
- ✅ Class-based filtering (applies to image & video)
- ✅ Filtered bounding boxes visualization
- ✅ CSV export of filtered detections
- ✅ Simple, clean Streamlit UI

## Application Overview

### Main Interface
- Upload an **image** or select a **video**
- Adjust model confidence
- Select classes to display
- Export filtered detections as CSV

### Example Outputs
- Original image/video
- Filtered detection results
- Detection table (class, confidence, bounding box coordinates)
